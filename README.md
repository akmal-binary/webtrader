Note\*: While submitting your PR, make sure that you deploy your code to your forked gh-pages by running following command, so that the reviewer can have a look at the deployed code at this url `$username.github.io/webtrader/branch-name`:

## Quick start

1.  **Install your dependencies:**

        ```sh
        $ cd webtrader
        $ npm install
        $ npm run build
        ```

2.  **To start developing:**

        ```sh
        npm start
        ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:9001`!



Note\*: Since backend needs an https web address for **oauth app register** if you intend to debug oauth login on localhost,  you need to modify your `/etc/hosts` file. For example the `https://webtrader.local/` token in `src/oauth/app_id.josn` is registered to `https://webtrader.local/` address, you need to do the following in order to use it locally.

*Add this line to your /etc/hosts file.*

        127.0.0.1 webtrader.local

*Use this command to run your local server on https.*

        $ sudo node_modules/.bin/grunt connect:https

*Use this command to watch the files.*

        $ node_modules/.bin/grunt && node_modules/.bin/grunt watch:https

Go to https://webtrader.local:35729 and accept the self signed ssl certificate for grunt livereload.

Now you can debug your app on https://webtrader.local/ locally.

To bump release version, run

        $ npm major-rel
        or
        $ npm minor-rel
        or
        $ npm patch-rel

Every check-in or merge into master will trigger travis-ci build and do a release to production.

Every check-in or merge of PR into development will trigger travis-ci build and do a beta release

### Translations

Translation related files are in `/translations` folder.
    
  To extract text for translation:

        ```sh
        $ npm run build
        $ cd ./translations
        $ python extract.py
        $ extract.py # extracts string literals from `dist/uncompressed` (from *.html and *.js)
        $ extract.py # for merging `.po` files uses `msgmerge` command line tool.
        ```

Note\*: The tool should be available on linux, if you are on Osx try `brew install gettext && brew link gettext --force`. 

Note\*: To submit text to translators: push to *translation* branch, weblate hook will be triggered.

Note\*: To see CrowdIn In-Context translations pass querystring `?lang=ach` (obs not for production env)
